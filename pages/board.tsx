              Iâ€™ve spent my career establishing high-performing teams and
              delivering results. I enjoy working with cross-functional teams
              with people from diverse backgrounds. My goal is to become a
              trusted advisor and partner with both developers and business
              leaders. I work towards leading the creation of tech solutions
              that range from innovative cloud-based web apps, mobile
              experiences, robust open APIs, and integrations with 3rd party
              apps. Although my expertise is in leading talented software
              engineers and product managers, I also have a passion for
              designing user experiences, code architecture, and the DevOps
              process.
