            WeCodeKC introduces coding for kids through project-based or game
            development learning. <br />
            <br />
            Our students begin their tech journey using Scratch, which is
            block-based coding, and gradually increase their skill levels to
            writing their own code in JavaScript and Python.
            <br />
            <br />
            WeCodeKC also introduces various other technology concepts including
            Virtual Reality, Machine Learning, and more!
